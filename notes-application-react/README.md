# React-Notes-Application
With all the node libraries and dependencies pre installed you can just download the project from the github location.

Then cd into the notes-application-react folder and then you can start the react application using 
	
	npm start

Make sure you run this in localhost and port 3000 since this is the cors header that is configured in our django application.

If you are using some other IP and port then make sure you update the same in 'CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST' field in the settings.py file in our django application.

Once it is done our application should run without any errors.
